## Overview instances

<p align="justify">
For each instance, two csv-files are available that contain the coordinates of the clients and the coordinates of the potential facilities. The csv-files are named using the ID of the instance and "coord_c" or "coord_f", respectively. For the instances that were adapted to the extension of the OPMP described in the paper, three additional csv-files are available. The first csv-file (named using the ID of the instance and "regions_c") comprises the regions the clients belong to. The second csv-file (named using the ID of the instance and "regions_f") includes the regions the potential facilities belong to. Finally, the third csv-file (named using the ID of the instance and "rhs_regions") comprises the upper bounds on the number of open facilities for each region.
